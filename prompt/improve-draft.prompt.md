I am solving the LeetCode question.
[Question Description] 

Here is my initial Rust draft (which might be influenced by other languages):
[Insert Code Here]

Please provide a comprehensive review including:

1. **The Rustacean Way:** Refine the code using idiomatic Rust (iterators, pattern matching, ownership optimization).
2. **Algorithm & Complexity:** Analyze the time/space complexity and explain the underlying algorithmic pattern.
3. **Blind Spot Detection:** Identify any edge cases or logic flaws I might have missed in my draft.
4. **The Why:** Explain why the idiomatic Rust version is not only cleaner but potentially more robust or performant.
5. **Key Rust Concept:** Provide some keywords about the key Rust Concept I might learn after the review.

Please be critical but constructive.
